// This is a sample translation file. It must contain an export default object like so but may contain any other code or values. This code will not be run or evaluated, only parsed, so only strings will be used. The values are also not used and only the keys are important. It is assumed the values will be looked up later on in the program by the `i18n.t` function.
export default {
  send: 'Send',
  receive: 'Receive',
  // this is a comment
  'please-enter-a-valid-word': 'Please enter a valid word',
  'enter-a-password': 'Enter a password',
  'passwords-must-be-8': 'The password must be at least 8 characters'
